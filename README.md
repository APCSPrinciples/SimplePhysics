Simple Physics
==============

Download [SimplePhysics.zip](https://github.com/APCSPrinciples/SimplePhysics/blob/master/SimplePhysics.zip?raw=true). Then right click on the downloaded zip file and choose *7-zip | Extract Here*. Then open sublime and choose *File | New Window* and then open the extracted SimplePhysics folder. You will need to create your own `main.lua` file by choosing *File | New File* and *File | Save As* and naming the file `main.lua`.
 
Follow the instructions on slides 91 - 106 to get the basic program running. Make sure you get all the way to slide 106 that shows `applyLinearImpulse`. Once you have it working, modify the program to make it your own. Have fun and be creative. Some suggestions are:
+ Add more images
+ Add `static` rectangles just off the screen to keep things from bouncing out of view
+ Use `math.random`
+ Use `transition.to` and/or `transistion.from`
